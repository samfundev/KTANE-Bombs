	<h2>What are seasons?</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>
			Seasons are timed events that will last for approximately 3 months each. During each season, players will compete
			for who can solve the most bombs that fit certain criteria explained in this page.
		</li>
		<li>
			The leaderboard for the season is separate from the global leaderboard, and is available through the "Seasons"
			button at the top of the page.
		</li>
		<li>
			The season leaderboards are not shared between seasons and players can only add solves to the leaderboard of a
			season during the 3 months that season is active.
		</li>
		<li>
			If you want a solve to be considered for the ongoing season, you need to activate the respective checkmark during
			the upload of the solve.
		</li>
		<li>
			At the end of each season, the top 3 players in each of these categories will get a reward: Total distinct solves,
			Team distinct solves and EFM distinct solves. The rewards will last during the following season and are:
		</li>
		<ul>
			<li>1st of each category: Colored name on this site and a colored role on the official KTANE server.</li>
			<li>2nd of each category: Colored name on this site</li>
			<li>3rd of each category: Colored name on this site</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
